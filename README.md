# Mixed Messages  
  
This project is part of the **Full-Stack Engineer** course on codecademy.com  
  
## Overview  
The expected output is a motivational emojis and motivational messages generator.  

## Project Goals  
The goal was to have an app that can run in Nodejs and that display the final information.  
I decided to have three outputs:  
+ The current day  
+ A random emoji  
+ A random motivational message  
  
I created two arrays containing messages and emojis and a variable that stores the current day.  
Through a function, a random emoji and message are selected and, finally, all the outputs are joined and displayed together.
